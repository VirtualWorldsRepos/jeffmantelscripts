This project regroups several Second Life opensource scripts originally written by Jeff Mantel. Most of them are related to [OpenCollar](http://code.google.com/p/opencollar/) or [RLV](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/RestrainedLifeAPI).

# Sub-projects #

  * AddOnInstaller: System used to manage an add-on in an [OpenCollar](http://code.google.com/p/opencollar/)
  * CardGame: an [OpenCollar](http://code.google.com/p/opencollar/) add-on for switches, that can exchange their roles based on cards

More to come ;)
