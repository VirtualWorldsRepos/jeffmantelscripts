This is a help notecard for the Opencollar add-on installer example.

To use the installer:

1) Go to a land where you can rez your own objects, with no autoreturn, or an autoreturn of more than 5 minutes
2) rez the installer (you can't use someone else's installer, it needs to be your own) 
3)   rez your collar next to the installer
4) touch your collar
5) go into the Help/Debug menu
6) select "Update"
7) from the menu, you can then install, update, or remove the add-on
8) pick your collar and wear it.

The collar will have a new name, so that you can differentiate it from the non updated collar. A letter is added to the name:
- I if the add-on was installed
- U if the add-on was upgraded
- R if the add-on was removed
You should rename the collar yourself to something more meaningfull once you get it back in your inventory.
